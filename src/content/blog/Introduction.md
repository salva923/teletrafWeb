Teletraffic engineering is the aplication of traffic engineering to comunication
networks.


Traffic engineering is a branch of civil engineering that uses engineering
techniques to achieve the safe and efficient movement of people and goods on
roadways; knowing this we can say that teletraffic studies the flow of information
through a telecomunication network and its main objective is to optimise
the data transmition.

Traffic metrics
Traffic is defined by the following metrics.
-   Load: The amount of data that goes   throug the system
-   Capacity: The maximum amount of  data     that can flow through a chanel or
    the whole syste.
-   Waiting time.(Self explanatory)

Traffic can be defined by the following measures

All in all the objective of the teletraffic engeeniering is to deliver as much data as posible, as fast as posible,as reliable as posible and as inexpesive as posible.
