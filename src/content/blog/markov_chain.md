Markov chains are a stochastic process that helps us to understand how things might happen in sequence.
There are two basic kinds of Markov chains DTMC(Discrete Time Markov Chain) and CTMC(Continuous Time Markov Chain).
Markov chains are in simple terms a number of states that have a certain probabilty to transition to other of the states and help us predict the behaviour of the system.

Here you can explore  a slide show exploring DTMC's.
